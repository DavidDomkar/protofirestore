# protofirestore

Go module for encoding/decoding protobuf messages to/from firestore documents.

Currently only supports encoding and the only supported well known types are google.protobuf.Timestamp and google.protobuf.Empty.

The module is still in early development and is not ready for production use. Any feedback or contributions are welcome.
